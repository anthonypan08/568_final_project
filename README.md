# SuMa++: Efficient LiDAR-based Semantic SLAM

This repository contains the implementation of SuMa++, which generates semantic maps only using three-dimensional laser range scans.

Developed by [Xieyuanli Chen](http://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/people/xieyuanli-chen/) and [Jens Behley](http://jbehley.github.io/projects/surfel_mapping/).

SuMa++ is built upon SuMa and RangeNet++. For more details, we refer to the original project websites [SuMa](https://github.com/jbehley/SuMa) and [RangeNet++](https://github.com/PRBonn/lidar-bonnetal).

##  Dependencies

* catkin
* Qt5 >= 5.2.1
* OpenGL >= 4.0
* libEigen >= 3.2
* gtsam >= 4.0

In Ubuntu 16.04: Installing all dependencies should be accomplished by
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake libgtest-dev libeigen3-dev libboost-all-dev qtbase5-dev libglew-dev libqt5libqgtk2 catkin
```

Additionally, make sure you have [catkin-tools](https://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and the [fetch](https://github.com/Photogrammetry-Robotics-Bonn/catkin_tools_fetch) verb installed:
```bash
sudo apt install python-pip
sudo pip install catkin_tools catkin_tools_fetch empy
```

## Build
#### rangenet_lib
To use SuMa++, you need to first build the rangenet_lib with the TensorRT and C++ interface. 
For more details about building and using rangenet_lib you could find in [rangenet_lib](https://github.com/PRBonn/rangenet_lib).

#### SuMa++
Clone the repository in the `src` directory of the same catkin workspace where you built the rangenet_lib:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PRBonn/semantic_suma.git
```
Download the additional dependencies (or clone [glow](https://github.com/jbehley/glow.git) into your catkin workspace `src` yourself):
```bash
catkin deps fetch
```

For the first setup of your workspace containing this project, you need:
  ```bash
catkin build --save-config -i --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DOPENGL_VERSION=430 -DENABLE_NVIDIA_EXT=YES
  ```
  
  Where you have to set `OPENGL_VERSION` to the supported OpenGL core profile version of your system, which you can query as follows:

```bash
$ glxinfo | grep "version"
server glx version string: 1.4
client glx version string: 1.4
GLX version: 1.4
OpenGL core profile version string: 4.3.0 NVIDIA 367.44
OpenGL core profile shading language version string: 4.30 NVIDIA [...]
OpenGL version string: 4.5.0 NVIDIA 367.44
OpenGL shading language version string: 4.50 NVIDIA
```

 Here the line `OpenGL core profile version string: 4.3.0 NVIDIA 367.44` is important and therefore you should use `-DOPENGL_VERSION = 430`. If you are unsure you can also leave it on the default version `330`, which should be supported by all OpenGL-capable devices.

 If you have a NVIDIA device, like a Geforce or Quadro graphics card, you should also activate the NVIDIA extensions using `-DENABLE_NVIDIA_EXT=YES` for info about the current GPU memory usage of the program.

 After this setup steps, you can build with `catkin build`, since the configuration has been saved to your current Catkin profile (therefore, `--save-config` was needed).
 
 Now the project root directory (e.g. `~/catkin_ws/src/semantic_suma`) should contain a `bin` directory containing the visualizer.

## How to run and use it?
**Important Notice**
- Before running SuMa++, you need to first build the [rangenet_lib](https://github.com/PRBonn/rangenet_lib) and download the pretrained [model](http://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/html/projects/semantic_suma/darknet53.tar.gz).
- You need to specify the model path in the configuration file in the `config/` folder.
- For the first time using, rangenet_lib will take several minutes to build a `.trt` model for SuMa++.
- SuMa++ now can only work with KITTI dataset.

All binaries are copied to the `bin` directory of the source folder of the project. Thus,
1. run `visualizer` in the `bin` directory by `./visualizer`,
2. open a Velodyne directory from the KITTI Visual Odometry Benchmark and select a ".bin" file,
3. start the processing of the scans via the "play button" in the GUI.
